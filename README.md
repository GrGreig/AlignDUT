# AlignDUT

Please see the AlignDUT manual for instructions on how to use. 

This repository contains the alignment scripts for determining a probe plan in the Semiprobe robot frame. The user locates and iterates finding a set of fiducials 
which are used to determine the offset and rotation of the sensor under test. Probe plans in the GDS referance frame are then shifted and rotated into the robot frame. 
Following this a striptest can be performed.
